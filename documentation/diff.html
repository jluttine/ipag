<h2>Differences to the original plan</h2>

<p>The plan was returned so late that the architecture was already polished and we had a pretty good picture of what the game is going to be like. This is why there are very little differences to the original plan. Item class was added as the base class for projectiles but it doesn't contain any functionality. Sprite was added as a helper class to store graphics. There are no counter-missiles, but otherwise all planned game features were kept and no new major fatures were added.</p>

<p>As was pointed out in the bugs section, architecture is far from perfect. A client/server architecture would allow us to add multiplayer network game. Projectile system should be more elegant and modules should be less aware of other modules.</p>
